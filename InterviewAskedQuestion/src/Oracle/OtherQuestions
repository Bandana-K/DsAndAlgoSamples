1. Develop a service that takes a list of product information in a CSV and generates a catalog.
2. Flatten a JSON object consisting of potentially multiple levels of nested objects, using a field renaming map.  
       { "accounting" : [   
	                     { "firstName" : "John",  
	                       "lastName"  : "Doe",
	                       "age"       : 23 },

	                     { "firstName" : "Mary",  
	                       "lastName"  : "Smith",
	                        "age"      : 32 }
        ]}
        
Round 2 : 
1. LRU cache design
2. What changes will we make to use it in multithreaded env
3. Design a payment gateway
