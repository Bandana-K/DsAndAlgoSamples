Round 2: (16th July 2021)

1. Current project architecture and is it okay to have single DB? is it monoloith or microServcie based/How are you doing authentication across the service.
2. Product management service, wher we will have product, its images and then the ratings/reviews for these products. How will we store them in DB.
	RDBMS for product, Amazon s3/CDN for the images with image urls stored in RDBMS, rating and reviews using NoSQL cassandra
3. Provide a Search service where if a user types something a list of all such objects with images and aggregated ratings for them
4. If we have to put a filter logic to show only the products with rating > 4
5. If we want to have a system where there can be many microservices, where one service is doing some task and on the result of it another service has to take some action. 
   How to design such system? - Kafka topics, even based systems - Each microService can be listening to different topics
6. We have millions of user accounts where their account details are with us. We want to design a system where we need to make sure that we keep only active accounts with us. 
	- Have a push system, but then the load will be with bank to notify our apps, which is not correct 
	- Have a scheduled job to come up every day and validate the accounts - for this we can have DB sharded - each service replica handling only a shard, 
	  To allocate which service handles which all shards, we can have a controller which generates the range and assigns. Also we need to have servcie discovery and health checks in place.
	  So that when a service replica goes down controller can sassign that range to a different servcie.
